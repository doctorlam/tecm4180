	  	<h3>Project 1 - Building a knowledge base for UNT freshman</h3>
	  		<h4>Description</h4>
	  			<p>For this assignment, you will create a knowledge base for IT-related information for freshman students at UNT. The knowledge base must be delivered in an online format using a website builder or by using HTML/CSS. You will work in teams of two to complete this project.</p>
	  			<p>As part of the project, you'll be required to conduct primary research by interviewing at least 4 freshman students at UNT. Based on this research, you will create an audience profile and an initial set of items for your knowledge base.</p>
	  			<p>This project will last approximately 6 weeks. Plan accordingly.</p>

	  		<h4>Deliverables</h4>
	  		<ol>
	  			<li>Primary research documents (e.g., copies of interview questions and answers, survey questions and answers, etc.)</li>
	  			<li>Audience profile describing demographic information, needs, wants, attitudes, and prior knowledge (1-3 single-spaced pages)</li>
	  			<li>Site Map and Wireframes</li>
	  			<li>Knowledge base of at least 10 topics and 20 entries.</li>
	  			<li>Project management spreadsheet w/ signatures</li>
			 </ol>
			 <h4>Grading Criteria</h4>
			 <ul>
			 	<li>Have you conducted primary research and is it clear that your final knowledge base reflects that research?</li>
			 	<li>Does you knowledge base include enough content and appropriate content?</li>
			 	<li>Is the writing technically correct and appropriate based on the needs of your audience? Are the articles structured and can they stand alone?</li>
			 	<li>Is the knowledge base easily navigable and is information extremely easy to find?</li>
			 	<li>Did your team put forth your best possible effort?</li>
	  		</ul>
	  		<h3>Project 2 - Infographic</h3>
	  			<h4>Description</h4>
	  				<p>You will create an infographic to educate a particular audience (determined by you) about a problem. The idea is to express some idea/concept/principle/piece of knowledge to the audience by visually displaying raw data in a meaningful and compelling way. You will have already selected a dataset to pull your raw data from. Be bold and creative while still adhering to core design principles we’ve discussed in class. </p>
	  				<p>This project will last approximately 2.5 weeks. Plan accordingly.</p>

	  			<h4>Deliverables and Requirements</h4>
	  				<ol>
	  					<li>1.	Communication goals worksheet- Follow Anderson’s guide to audience analysis on p. 62.</li>
						<li>Infographic- A 1 page visual document (can be print OR digital). This document should be self-explanatory. That is, you should communicate your core point in 1, and only 1, page. </li>
					</ol>

	 
	  				</ol>
	  			<h4>Grading Criteria</h4>
	  				<ul>
	  					<li>Does your inforgraphic utilize graphics appropriately?</li>
	  					<li>Does your infographic tell a very clear and compelling story to your audience?</li>
	  					<li>Is your infographic well designed and does it reflect the principles of visual design we learned in class?</li>
	  					<li>Is the content presented in a technically correct and appropriate way?</li>
	  				</ul>
	  		<h3>Project 3 - Video or other multimedia tutorial</h3>
	  			<h4>Project Description</h4>
	  				<p>You will develop a tutorial (it can be something brand new, or an entry from your knowledge base). The tutorial must NOT be written, but it must use some multimedia element to deliver your message. This means you can use ANY development tools you would. For example, you could create a video tutorial, screencast, illustration, or interactive web-based module. The idea is not for you to become an expert at video editing, post-production, or some other piece of software. Instead, the idea is to analyze what information you must convey and convey it in a clear and meaningful way to your audience.</p>
	  				<p>This project will last approximately 3 weeks. Plan accordingly.</p>

	  			<h4>Deliverables and Requirements</h4>
	  				<ul>
	  					<li>Audience analysis worksheet- A 1 page description of your target audience. It should contain a) information about your target demographic including things like gender, age, educational background, technical experience, and more. b) A list that outlines potential impacts your audience has on the document (e.g., Audience has little to no experience using XXX software, THEREFORE document will require explicit system orientation, clear language, and additional help resources.)</li>
						<li>Tutorial- A multimedia tutorial uploaded to Blackboard. Be sure to compress the file if it is too large. If compression is not an option, please plan for an alternate way to turn it in (via DVD or to my email address).</li>
	  				</ul>
	  			<h4>Grading Criteria</h4>
	  				<ul>
	  					<li>Does your video tutorial clearly and completely teach the audience the information you were trying to convey?</li>
	  					<li>Does your video tutorial reflect clear planning including a script and storyboard?</li>
	  					<li>Is your video tutorial chunked appropriately?</li>
	  					<li>Have you provided your audience with a clear way to navigate and find information in your tutorial?</li>

	  				</ul>
	  		<h3>Project 4 - Client User test and Report</h3>
	  			<h4>Project Description</h4>
	  			<p>This client project will involve designing and executing a user test for a web application. You will also be required to identify and recruit test participants for the test. Finally, you'll be required to write a formal, empirical report for the client.</p>
	  			<p>This project will last approximately 4 weeks. Plan accordingly.</p>
	  				
	  			<h4>Deliverables and Requirements</h4>
	  				<ul>
	  					<li>User testing documents (task overviews, data collection sheet, demographic information sheet)</li>
	  					<li>Empirical report (Introduction, objectives, method, results/discussion, and recommendations). See Anderson Chapter 25.</li>
	  				</ul>
	  			<h4>Grading Criteria</h4>
	  				<ul>
	  					<li>TBA</li>
	  				</ul>
