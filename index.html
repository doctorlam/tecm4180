	  	<h3>Course Description</h3>
	  	<p>This course is designed to be distinctly unique from TECM 2700. It is highly recommended that you have already taken TECM 2700 to be successful in this course. If you have not taken 2700, it is your responsibility to independently learn the concepts and genres presented in that course.</p>

		<p>TECM 4180 introduces you to the advanced aspects of technical communication and is not merely a survey of genres of technical communication (manuals, reports, correspondence, proposals, etc.). While you will create genres, the course focuses on the core concepts and competencies that a professional or technical communicator must have to be successful in a variety of organizational contexts.</p>

	  		<p>By the end of this course, you should be able to:</p>
	  		<ul>
	  			<li>Analyze the audience, context, and purpose of any situation and effectively communicate in written or oral communication.</li>
				<li>Differentiate technical writing from other forms of writing and employ a technical style across a variety of genres.</li>
				<li>Collect, analyze, and interpret data and draw conclusions from that data. They will also be able to write, design, and present complex data to a variety of audiences.</li> 
				<li>Design infographics, charts, graphs, and tables that present data in a clear and compelling way.</li>
				<li>Plan, script, and execute a video tutorial that teaches complex 
				<li>Work effectively in teams to complete a major client research project.</li>

	  		</ul>
	  	
	  	<h3>Required Books</h3>
	  	<p>You are required to purchase two books for this course. In addition, you'll also need internet access to access readings I post online.</p>
